# mandemthot
A much faster mandelbrot orbit plotter. This is due to Java/using a compiled
implementation of a language, really. This absolutely destroys the Python
mandeldot. It does about 10k points every frame without too much trouble, if you
ignore the screams coming from your [CG]PU.

It can also overlay orbits, and delete previously stored orbits. It does this by
making a cutesy little stack of PGraphics objects, which is quite cool.
